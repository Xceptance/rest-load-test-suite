# Java Garbage Collector Tuning 
#
# https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/gctuning/garbage-first-garbage-collector-tuning.htm
#
# Size the heap and the amount of agents per machine correctly. 25% of the machine memory
# should stay free for the OS at least. So with 30GB machine memory, you can run
# 4 at 5GB (they are bigger than 5G for the OS, that is just Heap). With 15GB machine 
# memory, you want to run only 2 at 5GB for instance.
#
# Smaller than 4G is not really cool for G1 GC. Is is made for larger heaps.
# Rather increase to 6G for instance on a 30GB machine and that should fit.

## The maximum pause time goal is specified. This is interpreted as a hint that pause 
## times of <N> milliseconds or less are desired; by default there is no maximum pause time goal. 
## If a pause time goal is specified, the heap size and other garbage collection related parameters
## are adjusted in an attempt to keep garbage collection pauses shorter than the specified value. 
## Note that these adjustments may cause the garbage collector to reduce the overall throughput of 
## the application and in some cases the desired pause time goal cannot be met.
